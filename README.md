## What's this?
This is the API for the pokemon battle application we made in the 7th week of the Codasseur full-stack web development academy. The API is linked to a postgres database that contains all the available pokemon and their corresponding properties and all the available moves. The API uses graphql, typeorm and vesper as its main technology.
